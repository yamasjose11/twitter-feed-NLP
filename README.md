## Analyzing Twitter Feed using NLP

### Overview: 

Life can be a roller coaster of emotions and full of experience from our political climate to the state of our mental health. With that said some of us are aware of the social dilemna that social media bring to our elderly down to our kids. Is social media as toxic as people make it out to seem or are we just over reacting? Here I will be exploring data from Twitter and follow through my normal workflow of analyzing, visualizing and cleaning the data for further analysis. The end goal for this idea is to analysize the average tweet choice of words and try to measure sentiment, gathered data from the social media platform, using NLP. With the help of machine learning we will try to get a best analysis of the effects of the site.
  
### Data: 

For gathering data Twitter offers an API but we can also go with well formatted cvs dataset from data.world.
